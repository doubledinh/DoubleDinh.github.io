Title: Final Project Daily Log
---

Below is a log of my daily progress, including:

1.) What I worked on today

2.) What I learned

3.) Any road blocks or questions that I need to get answered

4.) What my goals are for tomorrow

**January 7th**

Today, Hugh and I re-established our goals for our final project. We determined that we want to find/explore a python plugin that can measure the beat and tempo of a certain song. After we determined our goal, we researched and found an interesting plugin called Vamp and Sonic Annotator. Together they work in unison to read and process a song. We then pip installed vamp and librosa. We began experimenting, but the fire drill halted our progress. As for goals for tomorrow, Hugh and I hope to continue experimenting with vamp and exploring the data that it is able to gather. We also would like to find a way to mass import songs to produce a dataset ready for NLP analysis.
