Title: Final Project Daily Log
---

Below is a log of my daily progress, including:

1.) What I worked on today

2.) What I learned

3.) Any road blocks or questions that I need to get answered

4.) What my goals are for tomorrow

**January 7th**

Today, Hugh and I re-established our goals for our final project. We determined that we want to find/explore a python plugin that can measure the beat and tempo of a certain song. After we determined our goal, we researched and found an interesting plugin called Vamp and Sonic Annotator. Together they work in unison to read and process a song. We then pip installed vamp and librosa. We began experimenting, but the fire drill halted our progress. As for goals for tomorrow, Hugh and I hope to continue experimenting with vamp and exploring the data that it is able to gather. We also would like to find a way to mass import songs to produce a dataset ready for NLP analysis. 

**January 8th**

Today, Hugh and I ran into our first coding error. At first, we realized that librosa, a python plugin used to read in music files, defaulted to .wav files. We had originally used an online converter, however, since this course is practically computer science, we decided to research various python plugins to convert mp3 files. After a few attempts at brew installing the correct files, we successfully converted the audio file. Next, we tried to continue with the vamp protocal to covert the audio file into a matrix through one of vamp's plugins. However, we ran into another error: we had not installed the correct plugin. Tomorrow, our goal is to work through the issues with the solution you have provided and see if that solves the issue. If it does not, then we will continue to troubleshoot, but if it does, we will continue to see what we can do with the matrix produced from sonic annotator.
